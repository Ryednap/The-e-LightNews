**Note** : This project has been deployed on the cloud. Click here to redirect
**<a href="https://elightnews.herokuapp.com/" target="_blan"> e-lightNews</a>**

### Tech Stack 

This project entirely utilises **Java Spring Boot** Framework including **Hibernate**,
**JPA**, **Thymeleaf** and **Spring Security**. To display the news internally the application
uses **Rapid API's** <a href="https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-news-search1/" target="_blank">**Microsoft Bing News**</a> and <a href="https://newsapi.org/" target="_blank"> **NewsAPI** </a> 

**Note** : For security currently there's no token authorization and no remember-me feature. The activity is entirely 
maintained by session which lasts for approx. 30 minutes of duration after which user has to again login to the application.
